//! Read and write records: each write the guest made to a regular file,
//! with where in the file it went, and each open of a regular file, for
//! reading or for writing.
//!
//! The guest kernel appends them to a buffer in its memory without an exit
//! (see guest/linux/rewind-io.patch), and the monitor takes what the
//! buffer holds at every step. The records of one step go into the trace
//! as trace records of their own kind, [`KIND`], at that step, so a
//! replay that makes other records than its run made is caught as it is
//! for any other record.
//!
//! In the trace the records are encoded compactly, against what the
//! records before them named. Each file is given an id the first time a
//! record names its device and inode, and each path the first time one is
//! opened, stored as the bytes it shares with the path defined before it
//! and the rest. A write's position is stored as the distance from where
//! the file's last write ended, which is 0 for a file written front to
//! back, and a record's thread only when it is not the one before's. All
//! numbers are LEB128 varints. Decoding therefore reads a trace's records
//! in order from its first, and an encoder that goes on from a step of a
//! run, as a restored keyframe does, starts from the records up to it
//! ([`Encoder::resume`]).
//!
//! A record the guest's buffer had no room for is lost, and counted: the
//! trace says how many were lost at the step they would have been taken,
//! so a reader knows its view of that stretch is partial.
